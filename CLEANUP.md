# Minecraft Portfolio - Cleanup Report

## Issue Identified
The project had duplicate files and a confusing structure with:
1. A main directory with the core source code
2. A 'portfolio' subdirectory with similar structure but mostly empty
3. Duplicate 3D model files (scene.gltf and scene.bin)

## Cleanup Actions Taken

1. **Organized Project Structure**:
   - Ensured all source code is in the main `src` directory
   - Put static assets in the `public` directory following Next.js conventions
   - Moved 3D models to `public/models` directory

2. **Fixed Duplicates**:
   - Eliminated duplicate model files
   - Kept the working code from the main directory
   - Preserved node_modules for dependencies

3. **Updated Configuration**:
   - Enhanced start.bat with proper directory handling
   - Added a comprehensive .gitignore file
   - Updated README.md with better project structure documentation

4. **Added Missing Elements**:
   - Created a placeholder for the Minecraft font
   - Added proper directory structure for assets

## Current Status

The project is now organized in a clean, standard Next.js structure:
- All source code is in the `src` directory
- Static assets are properly organized in the `public` directory
- Configuration files are at the root level
- Dependencies are properly installed

## Next Steps

1. Consider removing the `portfolio` directory entirely once you've verified everything works correctly
2. Replace the font placeholder with an actual Minecraft-style font file
3. Run the application using the start.bat file to verify everything works properly

The project should now be much easier to maintain and understand.
