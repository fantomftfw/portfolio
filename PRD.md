# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Minecraft-Style Three.js Portfolio Website

### Project Overview
This project aims to create a distinctive portfolio website that showcases the developer's work through an interactive 3D environment built with Three.js, styled after the iconic Minecraft game aesthetics. The portfolio will combine the professional presentation needs of a developer portfolio with the nostalgic and engaging qualities of Minecraft's blocky visual style.

### Inspiration
The website draws inspiration from Hassan Karrach's portfolio (https://www.hassankarrach.me/) for its 3D workspace concept, while adopting Minecraft's visual language, including:
- Voxel-based geometry (blocky models)
- Pixelated textures
- Limited color palette
- Grid-based construction

### Core Features

#### 1. 3D Minecraft Scene
- **Workspace Environment**: A detailed Minecraft-style room featuring a desk, computer setup, bookshelves, and decorative elements
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Subtle lighting changes that shift based on time spent on site or user interaction
- **Weather Effects**: Optional particle systems for rain, snow, or other ambient effects
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable objects that reveal information or trigger animations

#### 2. Portfolio Content Sections
- **Hero/Introduction**: Name, title, and brief tagline with call-to-action
- **About Me**: Professional background, skills, and personal interests
- **Projects**: Showcased work with descriptions, technologies, and links
- **Skills/Technologies**: Visual representation of technical skills
- **Contact Information**: Methods to reach out, including social links

#### 3. Navigation & Interaction
- **Camera Controls**: Smooth transitions between different sections of the environment
- **Interactive Objects**: Hoverable and clickable elements that respond with animations
- **Mobile-Friendly Controls**: Touch-based interaction for mobile users
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Optional keyboard shortcuts for accessibility

#### 4. Visual Design
- **Minecraft Aesthetics**: 
  - Block-based structures with 16x16 pixel textures
  - Distinctive color palette resembling Minecraft
  - Chunky typography for headings
  - Pixelated UI elements
- **Professional Presentation**:
  - Clean layout for content
  - Readability prioritized over visual effects
  - Balanced composition between game aesthetics and professional information

#### 5. Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: 
  - Minimum 30 FPS on mid-range devices
  - Progressive loading of assets
  - Optimized textures and geometries
- **Compatibility**:
  - Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
  - Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
  - Fallback experience for devices without WebGL support
- **Accessibility**:
  - Alternative text navigation for screen readers
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Sufficient color contrast for text
  - Option to reduce motion

#### 6. Enhancements & Delighters
- **Easter Eggs**: Hidden interactive elements for users to discover
- **Minecraft Sound Effects**: Optional audio feedback for interactions
- **Day/Night Toggle**: User control for environment lighting
- **Mini-games**: Simple interactive elements (breaking blocks, placing blocks)
- **Weather Control**: Toggle for different particle effects
- **Custom Character**: Optional avatar that follows cursor

### Technologies
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js
- **Physics (Optional)**: Cannon.js or Ammo.js
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Babel
- **Asset Management**: Custom texture pipelines, GLTF models
- **Animation**: GSAP or native Three.js Tween
- **Performance**: Stats.js for monitoring

### Success Metrics
- Load time under 5 seconds on average connections
- Bounce rate below 40%
- Average session duration above 2 minutes
- Positive user feedback on visual appeal and navigation
- Project inquiry conversions

### Timeline Considerations
- Prototype with basic scene: 1-2 weeks
- Full environment development: 2-3 weeks
- Content integration: 1 week
- Testing and optimization: 1 week
- Total estimated timeline: 5-7 weeks

### Future Enhancements (v2)
- Multiplayer visitors (showing other current viewers)
- Expanded environment with multiple rooms
- Interactive resume as in-game achievement system
- Dynamic time-of-day based on visitor's local time
- More complex animations and particle systems
- Blog integration with Minecraft-style "books"

### Technical Constraints
- Asset sizes must be optimized for web loading
- Polygon count must be managed for mobile performance
- Consider bandwidth limitations for users
- Plan for graceful degradation on lower-end devices
